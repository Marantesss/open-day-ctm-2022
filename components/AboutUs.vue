      The Center for Telecommunications and Multimedia (CTM) is one of INESC
      TEC’s many research centers. This event, the
      <span class="underline font-title">CTM Open Day</span> aims to showcase
      the variety and quality of the technical and scientific work undertaken by
      CTM and its collaborators.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      This year, CTM is designing the event for you, the students! Throughout
      <span class="underline font-title">two full days</span> you’ll have the
      opportunity to attend four keynote speakers who are senior members of CTMs
      four scientific areas: Computer Vision and Machine Learning, Multimedia
      and Communications, Optical and Electrical Technologies, and Wireless
      Communications.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      But the main events are the several workshops our researchers and doctoral
      students have prepared for you! A total of five workshops, of 2 hours
      each, that we invite you to attend to learn what CTM does
      <span class="underline font-title">hands-on</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The event is <span class="underline font-title">free of charge</span>, but
      registration is mandatory, so stay tuned for any updates to the program
      and for the opening of the registration.
